  abstract  = {ABSTRACT We present an approach for the estimation of ore processing residue volumes in historical mine waste dumps by the use of different geophysical methods in combination with mineralogical investigations. The stamp mill dump in the Harz mountains, Germany was examined with the methods electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), ground penetrating radar (GPR) and spectral induced polarization (SIP) flanked by mineralogical studies at many drilling points. The mineralogical results were used to calibrate the geophysical results and to distinguish between valuable and non-valuable waste material. With SIP we investigated individual profiles and took lab samples. These lab results emphasize the differences between the fine-grained tailings of clayey silt to silty sand in the top layer and the sandy tailings underneath in both resistivity and phase. From the GPR results we can distinguish between different layers and various backfillings in the first two meters due to the much higher resolution than the other methods. From ERT we achieved an overview about the dimension and inner structure of the dump and the boundary between the sandy residual material and the host rock. To estimate the volume of the residual body we carried out 2D inversion of all ERT profiles followed interpolation between the inverted profiles. From the drilling interpretation, the SIP lab results and the ERT field measurements we defined a resistivity threshold of 350 ohm-m for the ore processing residues to achieve a 3-dimensional body of the dump. The volume of this body was then corrected by a factor due to consideration of uncertainties, e.g., forest areas, inaccessible dump sections, small-scale anomalies (geological or different anthropogenic nature) and inversion coverage. As a result, we were able to calculate the volume of the ore processing residues which can be used further for the determination of the economic potential (remaining metal content).},

  abstract         = {Understanding the interaction of terrestrial freshwater and seawater in the subterranean estuary (STE) is an important factor when considering nutrient fluxes from land to sea. State-of-the-art research describes the STE by a tide-induced upper saline recirculation cell, a freshwater discharge tube and a deep saltwater wedge. However, recent numerical modelling and shallow hydrogeochemical investigations for high-energy beaches indicate that multiple saline recirculation cells may exist and affect the land-sea interaction. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Direct Push (DP) technologies are common tools to explore the subsurface. Due to their sensitivity to the electrical conductivity of pore water, they permit investigating the STE. This study combines ERT and DP to image the salinity distribution within the STE of a meso-tidal, high-energy beach. We actively incorporate the DP data into the ERT inversion and use geostatistical regularization for closing the resolution gap. For the first time, our experimental results confirm the existence of several 10–20 m deep reaching upper saline recirculation cells and corresponding brackish discharge locations generated by a pronounced runnel-ridge beach system in 2019, whereas in 2021 only a single cell was displayed for a flat topography at the time.},
